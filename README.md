# 2 types of routing in web apps

    - Client Side Routing
        Whenever a new route is hit
        It just loads that component mapped to the route
        No Network calls are made
    - Server Side Routing
        Whenever a new route is hit
        A call to server is made
        Server returns an html page in response
        that html is rendered in browser
